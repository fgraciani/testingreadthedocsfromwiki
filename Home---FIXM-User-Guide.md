This document provides guidance and clarifications for the implementation of FIXM. It aims to build a "community knowledge" about the implementation of FIXM. It will therefore evolve over time in order to capture more alternatives, options and recommendations related to the use of FIXM. 

# General Guidance on FIXM implementation

This chapter provides general guidance for understanding the main FIXM
components, outlines general requirements for valid FIXM core and FIXM
extensions usage and describes the general rules (encoding rules, data
plausibility rules, rules for absent dataâ€¦) that are always applicable
whatever the implementation context. It therefore targets all FIXM
implementers.

# Using FIXM in Support of FF-ICE
This chapter provides specific guidance in support of the implementation
of FF-ICE using FIXM. It therefore targets FF-ICE Implementers.
